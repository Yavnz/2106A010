## üöÄ Overview

This repository provides a base GUI framework for students to develop and integrate machine learning methods. The GUI is built using PyQt6 and supports various classical machine learning and deep learning techniques. Students will extend this GUI by adding necessary functionalities over time.

---

## üìö Long-Term Homework Instructions

Students are required to modify and enhance this GUI incrementally every three weeks. The objective is to build a fully functional and improved machine learning GUI.

### üéØ Key Requirements:

*   **Insert Necessary Methods:** Integrate missing machine learning methods within the provided GUI framework.
*   **Enhance the GUI:** The default interface is provided, but students are encouraged to improve usability and design.
*   **Ensure Data and Method Appropriateness:** The datasets and algorithms should be compatible within the GUI structure.
*   **Implement Training and Testing Processes:** Correctly implement model training and evaluation workflows.
*   **Regular Submissions:** Submit updates every three weeks through Google Classroom for this course.
