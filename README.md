## 📚 Long-Term Homework Instructions

Students are required to modify and enhance this GUI incrementally every three weeks. The objective is to build a fully functional and improved machine learning GUI.

### 🎯 Key Requirements:

*   **Insert Necessary Methods:** Integrate missing machine learning methods within the provided GUI framework.
*   **Enhance the GUI:** The default interface is provided, but students are encouraged to improve usability and design.
*   **Ensure Data and Method Appropriateness:** The datasets and algorithms should be compatible within the GUI structure.
*   **Implement Training and Testing Processes:** Correctly implement model training and evaluation workflows.
*   **Regular Submissions:** Submit updates every three weeks through Google Classroom for this course.
